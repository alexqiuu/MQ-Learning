# MQ Learning: Reimagining Motivation with Psychometric Modeling & Softmax Scoring

## Overview

**MQ Learning (Motivation Quotient Learning)** is an innovative psychological insight platform that decodes an individual’s internal motivators using a proprietary trait-based assessment. It evaluates over 24 psychological “DNA traits” like **Curiosity**, **Ingenuity**, **Altruism**, and **Order**, then clusters them into six high-level motivational archetypes: **Innovator, Visioner, Practitioner, Integrator, Producer, and Administrator**.

Using a machine learning-inspired scoring model, MQ generates **personalized Motivation Maps** that more accurately reflect the salience of high-impact traits—empowering students, educators, HR teams, and coaches to make better-aligned decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Replace outdated average-based scoring with a **Softmax-weighted scoring system** to better reflect motivation intensity.
- Validate the new model with **A/B testing**, user feedback, and statistical comparisons.
- Develop scalable tools for **visualizing**, **benchmarking**, and **analyzing** individual and group motivational profiles.
- Bridge psychometric insights with real-world application in **education**, **career guidance**, **team formation**, and **wellness coaching**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Softmax-Based Motivation Map**  
  Captures motivational "spikes" by emphasizing dominant psychological traits using a softmax-weighted formula.

- **A/B Testing Validation**  
  Compared the new softmax method against traditional averaging across 6 archetypes using t-tests and user-level metrics.

- **Visualization Dashboard (R & ggplot2)**  
  Includes comparative bar charts, line graphs, and density plots to explain differences in scoring models and trait distributions.

- **Modular Code Design**  
  R scripts allow users to input new datasets, apply softmax scoring, and generate both summary tables and visual diagnostics.

## 🔢 Methodology & Algorithms

### Old Model:
Scores were averaged across traits within a category. This diluted the influence of dominant traits.

### New Model: Softmax Score  
We use:


Where `T = 10` (temperature) emphasizes higher trait scores while still incorporating all relevant values. Lower `T` makes sharper spikes.

## 📊 Validation Results

### A/B Test Design:
- **Group A (Control):** Users scored by average method  
- **Group B (Treatment):** Users scored using Softmax

We tested how well each method differentiated “top 25%” students using **t-tests across all six categories**.

### Highlights:
| Category      | Mean t-stat | Softmax t-stat | Softmax More Significant? |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Innovator     | -11.51      | **-11.70**      | ✅                        |
| Visioner      | -11.31      | **-12.11**      | ✅                        |
| Practitioner  | -13.16      | **-14.86**      | ✅                        |
| Integrator    | -10.01      | **-10.71**      | ✅                        |
| Producer      | -9.72       | **-10.17**      | ✅                        |
| Administrator | -13.01      | **-12.11**      | ✅                        |

- **Density plots** show Softmax scores are more right-skewed → better at identifying highly motivated individuals.
- **Scatter plots** confirm strong correlation between scoring methods, but Softmax better highlights “motivated outliers”.
